&nbsp;

* **This study measured the effectiveness of various drugs on 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth.**

* **We removed one mouse from the group (g989), because of duplicate timepoints in the study. 248 mice were analyzed for this study.**

* **We ultimately analyzed tumor volume using only the four drug treatments Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.**

* **Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective treatments. Capomulin was the most effective over all. Infubinol was clinically unsuccessful for tumor reduction.**

* **The most significant reduction in tumor volume occurred closer to the 45 day mark.**
